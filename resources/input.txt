Sunday the 11th of December that's going

**1:04**

to be not a very good day for you the

**1:08**

emotional planets are not very steady

**1:10**

they make you very changeable very moody

**1:13**

very over sensitive and you don't fit

**1:16**

into a theme somehow

**1:19**

so you'll have to be careful that you're

**1:20**

isolating yourself with all your plans

**1:22**

in the morning and afternoon

**1:24**

so why don't you turn things around to

**1:27**

become more practical

**1:29**

and that way you will see that being

**1:31**

part of a team would be good

**1:33**

it can be sometimes that you don't fit

**1:35**

into the company that's there well then

**1:38**

leave the company go find somebody else

**1:40**

don't have to suffer because of that

**1:43**

but the changeability in you can be very

**1:45**

annoying to other people

**1:47**

what you start you won't finish after

**1:49**

you change your halfway you will change

**1:51**

that so try to stick to what your plans

**1:55**

are or what the plans of other people is

**1:57**

stick to it and that would be better for

**2:00**

you some emotional areas are going to be

**2:03**

under stress

**2:04**

and that stress can lead to problems in

**2:07**

the emotional side of your life

**2:10**

you have to be also careful in the

**2:12**

evening Nightfall because the same

**2:14**

planners will follow you there but

**2:16**

luckily for you there are two of your

**2:18**

wonderful good planners there as well

**2:20**

these planets are the planets of

**2:22**

unexpected goodness

**2:24**

so you could meet very interesting

**2:26**

people that you can make use of or enjoy

**2:29**

their company at least you could meet

**2:32**

people like that in the evening night

**2:34**

for you can use these people their

**2:36**

energy for the job Improvement for the

**2:39**

business Improvement and anywhere to

**2:41**

improve your life

**2:43**

so for the sake of that I would say why

**2:45**

don't you go out in the evening I fall

**2:47**

the emotional planners on their own are

**2:50**

very lazy there's still not very much

**2:52**

keen and they are also neither here nor

**2:55**

there so fix a plan to be with people

**2:58**

who can help you and that will get you

**2:59**

something going in the evening lightful

**3:02**

Monday the 12th of December

**3:05**

this is not a good day because the

**3:07**

planets make you dominating they make

**3:09**

you stubborn and they make you want to

**3:11**

control people

**3:12**

so avoid doing that where you work or

**3:15**

where you do business or whether at home

**3:18**

or whether anywhere try to be negotiable

**3:22**

try to be flexible that way you will

**3:25**

control these planets in the morning

**3:26**

afternoon and that way you'll work along

**3:29**

with people and they will like to work

**3:31**

along with you show this back to your

**3:33**

bosses and in business show respect to

**3:36**

the majority of people who are doing

**3:38**

business with you because this

**3:41**

domination tactics will not go down very

**3:43**

well simply because they are not your

**3:45**

positive planners

**3:48**

evening and Nightfall many of these

**3:50**

planets follow you but luckily there are

**3:52**

some of your wonderful planners there as

**3:54**

well the planets of creativity the

**3:57**

planets of good luck

**3:58**

being able to be on the same wavelength

**4:01**

with people and to be able to fit it

**4:03**

with any kinds of plans that people make

**4:06**

you will still tend to be dominating you

**4:09**

will stand still tend to be done to be

**4:11**

stubborn but maybe a bit less in the

**4:13**

evening night floor

**4:14**

so lessen that area and improve the area

**4:17**

of your creativity and being on the same

**4:20**

wavelength as people you can use these

**4:23**

good energies for anything chasing for

**4:25**

the romance making a deal business-wise

**4:28**

meeting people to get a better job

**4:30**

anything

**4:32**

all you need to do is don't Dominate and

**4:34**

don't want to control

how you do that and being flexible as

well that way you'll have the whole day

**9:19**

the whole night to have a wonderful time

**9:22**

Friday

**9:23**

Friday the 16th of December is a nasty

**9:26**

day firstly where finances are concerned

**9:29**

the insecurity is that so job is at risk

**9:32**

Investments are at risk don't listen to

**9:35**

people's ideas of giving you that tip

**9:37**

and adaptive you're going to lose your

**9:39**

pants if you're not careful in the

**9:41**

morning afternoon

**9:42**

nothing is stable

**9:44**

so watch out where you work don't say

**9:47**

the wrong thing and try to harmonize

**9:49**

with everybody especially your bosses in

**9:52**

business don't sign on the dotted line

**9:54**

you don't want to sign any contracts or

**9:57**

agree to anything the whole day

**9:59**

including the night as well because

**10:01**

everything that can go wrong wants to go

**10:04**

wrong accidents are included accidents

**10:07**

can be physical they can be verbal they

**10:10**

can be health-wise so so many things

**10:13**

want to go wrong in the morning

**10:14**

afternoon what can you do about it well

**10:16**

you're going to be blamed that's what's

**10:18**

going to happen so make sure your

**10:20**

responsibilities are covered very nicely

**10:23**

don't delegate your duties it's going to

**10:25**

go wrong somebody else will get but get

**10:27**

it all wrong and you'll get the blame so

**10:30**

just fix yourself to say my

**10:32**

responsibilities morning afternoon let

**10:34**

me do that first before anything else

**10:37**

you can be bonding with bad people so

**10:40**

don't be the company of people lunch

**10:42**

time who drink too much that's a bonding

**10:44**

with bad people or other habits as well

**10:47**

evening and Nightfall these nasty

**10:49**

planners follow you

**10:50**

I would say don't even bother going out

**10:52**

but there's one planet there who wants

**10:55**

to give you some good news and that good

**10:57**

news is more on the friendly business

**10:59**

side

**11:00**

it may be a wonderful tip to improve

**11:03**

your job or improve your business so for

**11:05**

that sake maybe go out but drive very

**11:08**

carefully drive very slowly and leave

**11:11**

that place early as you can after

**11:13**

meeting this person or you feel that you

**11:15**

rather not go out at all I prefer that

**11:18**

because nothing seems to want to work

**11:20**

for you Friday the 16th of December only

**11:23**

to harm you

**11:25**

Saturday the 17th of December this is a

**11:29**

much better day but planets are moving

**11:31**

very slow and you get frustrated with

**11:33**

the slowness of things

**11:35**

but tell yourself these slow planets are

**11:38**

going to bond going to help to bond me

**11:41**

with the correct people this time

**11:43**

so there's a meeting of people in the

**11:45**

morning afternoon there could be already

**11:47**

you know them or you from your past or

**11:50**

there could be brand new people

**11:52**

try to see how you can create the

**11:54**

bonding and you will see the long-term

**11:56**

planets will make you very secure

**11:59**

because the bonding will take place

**12:01**

short-term planners will produce very

**12:03**

good results because of the bonding so

**12:06**

there's a bonding with people all the

**12:08**

ideas or their contexts the same thing

**12:12**

happens in the evening Nightfall so plan

**12:14**

your evening night fold to build up your

**12:16**

context for what's important for you

**12:18**

there's one nasty planet in the evening

**12:21**

night for the planet who wants to make

**12:23**

you secretive

**12:25**

which means you have to hide to do

**12:27**

things well don't go there and also the

**12:30**

planet of

**12:32**

what's the word depending on things like

**12:35**

drugs or cigarettes or all these kind of

**12:38**

nasty things avoid people like who drink

**12:40**

too much for example so avoid such a

**12:43**

company and you will let your good

**12:45**

planners do wonderful things for you in

**12:47**

the evening Nightfall as well

**12:49**

hour by hour the evening Nightfall lays

**12:52**

out a platform for you it's all up to

**12:54**

you to choose the company carefully

**12:56**

that's all and you will score many

**12:58**

wonderful points

**13:00**
